        BRUSSELS - The European Commission announced sweeping new regulations
        targeting major technology companies on Monday, marking the most
        significant expansion of the Digital Services Act since its implementation.

        Commissioner Margrethe Vestager stated that Apple, Google, Meta, and
        Microsoft must comply with new data portability requirements by June 2025.
        "European citizens deserve control over their digital lives," Vestager
        said during a press conference at the European Parliament.

        The regulations require tech companies to allow users to export their
        data in standardized formats and prohibit certain algorithmic practices
        that the Commission deems anticompetitive.

        Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, expressed concern about the timeline in a statement
        released Tuesday. "While we support the goals of data portability, the
        implementation deadline presents significant technical challenges."

        The announcement sent tech stocks tumbling, with the NASDAQ falling 2.3%
        in afternoon trading. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate compliance costs
        could reach $5 billion annually across affected companies.

        DUBAI - World leaders reached a landmark climate agreement at the UN
        Climate Change Conference on Saturday, committing to a 60% reduction in
        global emissions by 2035.

        UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the agreement "a turning
        point for humanity" during the closing ceremony. The deal was brokered
        after intense negotiations between the United States, China, and the
        European Union.

        President Biden praised the agreement, stating, "This proves that when
        nations work together, we can tackle the greatest challenges of our time."
        Chinese Premier Li Qiang committed to tripling renewable energy capacity
        by 2030.

        Environmental groups had mixed reactions. Greenpeace International
        director Jennifer Morgan welcomed the emissions targets but criticized
        the lack of specific enforcement mechanisms.

        The agreement includes a $500 billion climate fund, with contributions
        from wealthy nations to help developing countries transition to clean
        energy. India and Brazil successfully negotiated provisions for "just
        transition" financing.

        The next major review conference is scheduled for Glasgow in 2027.

        TOKYO - A powerful 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck Japan's Noto Peninsula
        early Sunday morning, causing widespread damage and triggering tsunami
        warnings across the Sea of Japan.

        Prime Minister Fumio Kishida declared a state of emergency and mobilized
        the Self-Defense Forces for rescue operations. "Our top priority is
        saving lives," Kishida told reporters at an emergency press conference.

        The Japan Meteorological Agency reported the earthquake struck at 4:10 AM
        local time, with the epicenter located 10 kilometers beneath Wajima City.
        Aftershocks continued throughout the day, with at least 20 measuring
        above magnitude 5.0.

        Ishikawa Prefecture Governor Hiroshi Hase reported significant damage to
        infrastructure, including collapsed buildings in Suzu and Nanao cities.
        The famous Kenrokuen Garden in Kanazawa sustained minor damage.

        The Red Cross dispatched emergency medical teams to the affected region.
        International aid offers came from the United States, South Korea, and
        Taiwan within hours of the disaster.

        Tokyo Electric Power Company reported no damage to nuclear facilities,
        though several thermal power plants were temporarily shut down as a
        precautionary measure.
