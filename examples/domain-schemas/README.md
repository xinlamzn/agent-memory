# Domain Schema Examples

This directory contains example applications demonstrating GLiNER2 domain schemas for entity extraction in different domains.

## Overview

GLiNER2 supports **domain schemas** - predefined sets of entity types with natural language descriptions that help the model understand what to extract. Using domain-specific schemas significantly improves extraction accuracy compared to generic entity types.

## Available Examples

| Example | Schema | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `poleo_investigations.py` | `poleo` | Investigation/intelligence analysis (POLE+O model) |
| `podcast_transcripts.py` | `podcast` | Podcast and interview transcripts |
| `news_articles.py` | `news` | News articles and journalism |
| `scientific_papers.py` | `scientific` | Research papers and academic content |
| `business_reports.py` | `business` | Business documents and earnings reports |
| `entertainment_content.py` | `entertainment` | Movies, TV shows, and celebrity content |
| `medical_records.py` | `medical` | Clinical documents and healthcare content |
| `legal_documents.py` | `legal` | Legal cases, contracts, and regulatory filings |

## Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

1. Install the package with GLiNER support:
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv sync --all-extras
   
   # Or using pip
   pip install neo4j-agent-memory[gliner]
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up Neo4j for entity storage:
   ```bash
   # Copy and edit environment file
   cp ../.env.example ../.env
   # Edit ../.env with your NEO4J_URI and NEO4J_PASSWORD
   ```

   If Neo4j is not configured, examples will still run and demonstrate extraction - they just won't persist entities to Neo4j.

### Run an Example

```bash
# Run without Neo4j (extraction only)
uv run python examples/domain-schemas/podcast_transcripts.py

# Run with Neo4j storage
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687 NEO4J_PASSWORD=password \
  uv run python examples/domain-schemas/podcast_transcripts.py
```

## Creating Custom Schemas

You can create custom schemas for your specific domain:

```python
from neo4j_agent_memory.extraction.gliner_extractor import DomainSchema, GLiNEREntityExtractor

# Define a custom schema
real_estate_schema = DomainSchema(
    name="real_estate",
    entity_types={
        "property": "A real estate property, building, or land",
        "agent": "A real estate agent or broker",
        "buyer": "A property buyer or purchaser",
        "seller": "A property seller or owner",
        "price": "A property price or valuation",
        "location": "A neighborhood, city, or address",
        "feature": "A property feature or amenity",
    },
)

# Create extractor with custom schema
extractor = GLiNEREntityExtractor(schema=real_estate_schema, threshold=0.5)

# Extract entities
result = await extractor.extract(property_listing_text)
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Adjust threshold**: Lower threshold (0.3-0.4) extracts more entities but may include noise. Higher threshold (0.6-0.7) is more precise but may miss entities.

2. **Use GPU acceleration**: Set `device="cuda"` or `device="mps"` for faster inference.

3. **Batch processing**: Process multiple documents in parallel using asyncio.

4. **Filter results**: Always call `result.filter_invalid_entities()` to remove noise.

## Sample Output

```
Initializing GLiNER2 extractor with podcast schema...
  Model: gliner-community/gliner_medium-v2.5

Episode 1: Growth Strategies with Elena Rodriguez
Guest: Elena Rodriguez, VP of Growth at Stripe
--------------------------------------------------
  Entities extracted: 15

  ORGANIZATION:
    - Stripe (89%)
    - Mercado Libre (85%)

  PERSON:
    - Elena Rodriguez (92%)
    - Patrick Collison (88%)
    - Sean Ellis (76%)

  OBJECT:
    - Stripe Atlas [PRODUCT] (81%)
    - PMF survey [CONCEPT] (72%)
```

## Troubleshooting

### GLiNER Not Installed

If you see an error about GLiNER not being installed:

```
ERROR: GLiNER is not installed.

To run this example, install GLiNER:
  uv sync --all-extras
  # or: pip install gliner
```

Install the GLiNER dependency and try again. The first run will download the GLiNER model (~500MB).

### Slow First Run

The first time you run an example, GLiNER downloads its model weights. Subsequent runs will be much faster as the model is cached locally.

### Low Confidence Scores

If extraction produces low confidence scores or misses expected entities:
- Try lowering the `threshold` parameter (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.3)
- Use a domain schema that better matches your content
- Consider creating a custom schema with more specific entity descriptions
