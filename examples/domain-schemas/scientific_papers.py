"""Scientific Schema Example: Research Paper Analysis

This example demonstrates the scientific schema for extracting entities from
research papers, academic publications, and scientific content.

The scientific schema includes entity types like author, institution, method,
dataset, metric, concept, and tool commonly found in academic literature.

        Abstract: We present LongFormer-X, a novel transformer architecture
        designed for efficient processing of documents exceeding 100,000 tokens.
        Building on the work of Beltagy et al. (2020) and the Longformer model,
        our approach introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism that reduces
        computational complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).

        We evaluate LongFormer-X on the SCROLLS benchmark, the Long Range Arena,
        and a new dataset we introduce called BookSum-Extended. Our model achieves
        state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks while using 40% less memory
        than comparable approaches.

        Key contributions: (1) A novel chunked attention pattern with learned
        routing, (2) An efficient implementation using FlashAttention-2, and
        (3) A comprehensive ablation study demonstrating the importance of
        each component.

        Our code and pretrained models are available on GitHub. All experiments
        were conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs at the Stanford AI Lab.

        "venue": "ICML 2024",
        "content": """
        Abstract: We introduce Constitutional AI Learning (CAIL), a method for
        training language models to follow a set of principles without extensive
        human feedback annotation. Unlike RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human
        Feedback), CAIL requires only a constitution of principles written in
        natural language.

        Our experiments on the Claude model family demonstrate that CAIL reduces
        harmful outputs by 73% compared to baseline, as measured on the HarmBench
        and ToxiGen evaluation suites. We also evaluate on the MMLU benchmark
        to ensure capability is preserved.

        The training pipeline uses a combination of supervised fine-tuning on
        principle-following demonstrations and a novel critique-revision loop.
        We implement this using PyTorch and the HuggingFace Transformers library.

        Our analysis reveals that the effectiveness of CAIL depends critically
        on the specificity and comprehensiveness of the constitutional principles.
        We provide guidelines for practitioners based on experiments with over
        200 different constitution variants.

        "content": """
        Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of graph neural
        network (GNN) applications in drug discovery. We review 247 papers
        published between 2018 and 2024, categorizing methods by their primary
        task: molecular property prediction, drug-target interaction, de novo
        design, and reaction prediction.

        Key architectures discussed include Message Passing Neural Networks
        (MPNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and the recently proposed
        Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs). We benchmark 15 representative
        methods on MoleculeNet, PCBA, and the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC).

        Our analysis reveals that GNN performance on molecular property prediction
        has plateaued, with newer architectures providing diminishing returns.
        However, we identify promising directions in geometric deep learning
        and multi-modal approaches combining molecular graphs with protein
        structures.

        We release DrugGNN-Bench, a standardized evaluation framework implemented
        in PyTorch Geometric with support for 50+ GNN architectures and 30+
        benchmark datasets.
