        Subject: Suspicious Transaction Report - Operation Phantom

        Investigation into suspected money laundering operation centered on
        John Marcus Reynolds, CEO of Meridian Holdings LLC. Reynolds was observed
        meeting with Viktor Petrov at the Grand Continental Hotel in Zurich on
        March 15, 2024.

        Wire transfers totaling $2.3 million were traced from Meridian Holdings
        to offshore accounts at First Caribbean Trust in the Cayman Islands.
        The funds originated from Apex Trading Partners, a shell company registered
        in Delaware with no apparent business operations.

        A black Mercedes S-Class (license plate ZH-482991) registered to Meridian
        Holdings was observed at multiple meeting locations. Cell phone records
        indicate calls between Reynolds and known associate Maria Santos, who
        manages Cyprus-based Helios Investments.

        a 45-foot yacht named "Sea Shadow" (registration FL-8827-MK). He was
        accompanied by two unidentified males in business attire.

        Reynolds met with Carlos Mendez, previously flagged in Operation Nightfall
        for suspected drug trafficking connections. The meeting lasted approximately
        45 minutes at the marina's private club.

        A laptop computer and multiple document folders were exchanged during the
        meeting. Reynolds departed at 16:15, traveling to Miami International Airport
        where he boarded a private jet (tail number N482JR) with flight plan filed
